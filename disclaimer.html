      <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 6, 2026</p>

      <section>
        <h2>1. General Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          The information provided on Rupiya is for informational and educational purposes only. Rupiya is a financial management and tracking tool designed to help you organize and monitor your investments. <strong>We are NOT a financial advisor, investment advisor, broker, or financial institution.</strong>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Data Security & Privacy</h2>
        <div class="security-highlight">
          <h4>🔐 Your Data is Completely Private and Secure</h4>
          <p>We implement military-grade end-to-end encryption to protect your financial data. Your information is encrypted on your device before transmission and remains encrypted in our systems.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>2.1 Zero-Knowledge Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>We cannot access your encrypted financial data.</strong> Rupiya uses a zero-knowledge architecture where your sensitive information is encrypted with keys that only you possess. This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Complete Privacy:</strong> Even our administrators cannot view your encrypted financial data</li>
          <li><strong>Client-Side Encryption:</strong> Data is encrypted on your device before being sent to our servers</li>
          <li><strong>Your Keys Only:</strong> Only you have the encryption keys to decrypt your information</li>
          <li><strong>No Data Access:</strong> We have designed our system so we cannot access your sensitive data even if legally compelled</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 What This Means for You</h3>
        <p>
          Your financial transactions, investment details, account information, and personal data are protected with AES-256 encryption - the same standard used by banks and government agencies. If our servers were compromised, your data would remain secure because it's encrypted with keys only you possess.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Data Security Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
          While we implement robust security measures including end-to-end encryption, no system is 100% secure. You are responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keeping your login credentials secure and confidential</li>
          <li>Using strong, unique passwords</li>
          <li>Not sharing your account access with unauthorized persons</li>
          <li>Using secure devices and networks when accessing the Application</li>
          <li>Immediately reporting any suspected security breaches</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We are not liable for unauthorized access resulting from your failure to maintain the security of your credentials or device.
