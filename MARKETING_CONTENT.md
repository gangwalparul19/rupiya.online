### Post 4: Security & Privacy Focus

🔐 Your financial data deserves bank-level security.

When building Rupiya, security wasn't an afterthought - it was the foundation.

Here's how we protect your data:

In a world of data breaches, we chose to build different.

### Post 5: Developer Journey / Behind the Scenes
```
🛠️ From idea to launch: Building Rupiya

6 months ago, I was frustrated with existing finance apps:
- Too complex
- Not India-focused
- Missing household features
- Poor offline support

So I built what I needed.

Tech stack:
→ Vanilla JS (no framework bloat)
→ Firebase (Auth + Firestore)
→ PWA (works offline, installs on phone)
→ Responsive design (mobile-first)

Key learnings:
1. Simplicity wins over features
2. Offline-first is crucial for India
3. Security can't be compromised
4. User feedback shapes everything

The journey continues. New features dropping soon!
