### Post 6: Vehicle Expense Tracking

Most people track fuel. That's it.

But real vehicle costs include:
⛽ Fuel

🅿️ Parking & tolls
🔩 Repairs & parts

Rupiya's Vehicle Tracker captures EVERYTHING:

✅ Multiple vehicles (car, bike, scooter)
✅ Fuel log with mileage calculator

✅ Insurance renewal alerts
✅ Cost per kilometer analysis
✅ Expense trends over time

Finally know your true cost of ownership.

Rupiya lets you track them ALL:
