          Rupiya implements military-grade security measures to protect your financial data. We use end-to-end encryption with AES-256 encryption standards to ensure your information remains secure and private.
        </p>
        
        <h3>8.2 Zero-Knowledge Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          We have designed our system using a zero-knowledge architecture, which means we cannot access your encrypted financial data even if we wanted to. Your data is encrypted with keys that only you possess.

        <h3>8.3 User Responsibilities</h3>

          <li>Using strong, unique passwords</li>
          <li>Not sharing your account access with unauthorized persons</li>

        <h3>8.4 Data Encryption</h3>

          All sensitive financial data including transactions, account information, and personal details are encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols. This encryption occurs on your device before data transmission to our servers.
