        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 End-to-End Encryption</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Your financial data is protected with military-grade encryption.</strong> We implement end-to-end encryption using AES-256 encryption, the same standard used by banks and government agencies. This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Client-Side Encryption:</strong> Your data is encrypted on your device before being sent to our servers</li>
          <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge Architecture:</strong> We cannot access your encrypted data even if we wanted to</li>
          <li><strong>Your Keys, Your Data:</strong> Only you have the encryption keys to decrypt your information</li>
          <li><strong>Automatic Encryption:</strong> All sensitive data including expenses, income, investments, and personal information is automatically encrypted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Data Storage</h3>
        <p>
          Your encrypted data is stored securely using Google Firebase, a leading cloud infrastructure provider with enterprise-grade security. All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols (TLS 1.3).
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Security Measures</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AES-256 Encryption:</strong> Military-grade encryption for all sensitive financial data</li>
          <li><strong>PBKDF2 Key Derivation:</strong> Secure key generation with 100,000+ iterations</li>
          <li><strong>Secure Authentication:</strong> Password hashing with bcrypt and secure session management</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> Continuous vulnerability assessments and penetration testing</li>
          <li><strong>Firewall Protection:</strong> Advanced DDoS mitigation and intrusion detection</li>
          <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Role-based permissions and multi-factor authentication</li>
          <li><strong>Automatic Backups:</strong> Encrypted backups with disaster recovery procedures</li>
          <li><strong>Security Monitoring:</strong> 24/7 monitoring for suspicious activities and threats</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.4 What This Means for You</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Complete Privacy:</strong> Even if our servers were compromised, your financial data would remain secure because it's encrypted with keys only you possess. We have designed our system so that we cannot access your sensitive information, ensuring your privacy is protected at all times.
        </p>

        <h3>4.5 Data Retention</h3>
        <p>
          We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide our services. You can request deletion of your account and associated data at any time, subject to legal retention requirements. Upon deletion, your encrypted data is permanently removed from our systems.
